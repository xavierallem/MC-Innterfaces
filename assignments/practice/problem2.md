# Problem 2

### Purpose : Convert Thingsboard code into Shunya Interfaces MQTT API's

### Expected Outcomes: 
1. C/CPP code `thingsboard.cxx` for Thingsboard with all functions preserved.
1. C/CPP code `thingsboard_example.cxx` contains main function that uses the functions in the `thingsboard.cxx` file to send telemetry data to thingsboard platform.
1. Document on how to use Thingsboard functions.


### Steps to complete 
- Go through the Documentation on thingsboard - https://thingsboard.io/docs/reference/gateway-mqtt-api/
- Go through the Shunya Interfaces MQTT API's - http://demos.iotiot.in/si/docs/reference/connectivity/ref-mqtt
- Understand the given `thingsboard.cxx` code.
- Convert the code into Shunya interfaces MQTT API.


### Acceptance Criteria 
This is the criteria to accept the assignment.
- The code must be divided into functions 
- **Must** have documentation for using the program.
- Code **Must** follow the Coding Standards.
- Code must be in C.
- Code must be compiled in the Shunya OS docker container.
