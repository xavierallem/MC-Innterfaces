# Summary 

## Analog to Digital Converter (ADC)

An ADC converts a continuous-time and continuous-amplitude analog signal to a discrete-time and discrete-amplitude digital signal. The conversion involves quantization of the input, so it necessarily introduces a small amount of error or noise. Furthermore, instead of continuously performing the conversion, an ADC does the conversion periodically, 
sampling the input, limiting the allowable bandwidth of the input signal.

### Resolution

The resolution of the converter indicates the number of different, ie discrete, values it can produce over the allowed range of analog input values. Thus a particular resolution determines the magnitude of the quantization error and \
therefore determines the maximum possible signal-to-noise ratio for an ideal ADC without the use of oversampling.



## Digital to Analog Converter(DAC)

In electronics, a digital-to-analog converter (DAC, D/A, D2A, or D-to-A) is a system that converts a digital signal into an analog signal.
DACs are commonly used in music players to convert digital data streams into analogue audio signals.
