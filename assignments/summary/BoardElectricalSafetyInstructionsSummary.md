# Summary 


## Tips

### Power Suppy 

- Make sure to connect supply voltage matching the input voltage of the board
- Never connect a higher output(12V/3Amp) to a lower (5V/2Amp) input .
- Make sure all the connections are proper before supplying the voltage with proper connector.


### Handling

- Never do changes to the board while power is ON and do the changes when its turned OFF or Unplugged.
- Keeep the Board on flat surfaces and avoid wet hands while touching the board.
- Keep all electrical circuit contact points enclosed and dont touch the metal contacts.
- If the board becomes too hot try to cool it with a external usb fan.

### GPIO 

- Connection must be proper according to board logic and connect only according to that 5v or 3.3v else use converters.
- Use ressitors with LEDs
- Avoid changes while Board is ON
- Use motors with transistors and never connect  voltage higher than board voltage.
