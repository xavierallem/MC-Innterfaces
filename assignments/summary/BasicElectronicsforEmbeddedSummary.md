## Sensors & Actuators

- **Sensors**:- Sensor is a device used for the conversion of physical events or characteristics into the electrical signals. 
This is a hardware device that takes the input from environment and gives to the system by converting it.

- **Actuators**:- Actuator is a device that converts the electrical signals into the physical events or characteristics. 
It takes the input from the system and gives output to the environment.

## Analog & Digital Signals

- **Analog Signals**:- Analog signal is a continuous signal in which one time-varying quantity represents another time-based variable. These kind of signals works with physical values and natural 
phenomena such as earthquake, frequency, volcano, speed of wind, weight, lighting, etc.

- **Digital Signals**:- A digital signal is a signal that is used to represent data as a sequence of separate values at any point in time. It can only take on one of a fixed number of values. 
This type of signal represents a real number within a constant range of values.
