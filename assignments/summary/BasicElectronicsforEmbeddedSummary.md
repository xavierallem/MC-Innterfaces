## Sensors & Actuators

- **Sensors**:- Sensor is a device used for the conversion of physical events or characteristics into the electrical signals. 
This is a hardware device that takes the input from environment and gives to the system by converting it.

- **Actuators**:- Actuator is a device that converts the electrical signals into the physical events or characteristics. 
It takes the input from the system and gives output to the environment.

## Analog & Digital Signals

- **Analog Signals**:- Analog signal is a continuous signal in which one time-varying quantity represents another time-based variable. These kind of signals works with physical values and natural 
phenomena such as earthquake, frequency, volcano, speed of wind, weight, lighting, etc.

- **Digital Signals**:- A digital signal is a signal that is used to represent data as a sequence of separate values at any point in time. It can only take on one of a fixed number of values. 
This type of signal represents a real number within a constant range of values.

## Micro-controller Vs Micr0-processor

- **Micro-Controller**:- It’s like a small computer on a single IC. It contains a processor core, ROM, RAM and I/O pins dedicated to perform various tasks. 
Microcontrollers are generally used in projects and applications that require direct control of user. 

- **Micro-Processor**:- Microprocessor has only a CPU inside them in one or few Integrated Circuits. Like microcontrollers it does not have RAM, ROM and other peripherals. 
They are dependent on external circuits of peripherals to work.

_**Example**_:- Lets us Consider Arduino Uno(Micro-Controller) & Rasp Pi (Micro-Processor)

- **Features**:-

    - Mini Computer
    - Limited but large power for its size
    - No storage
    - It is a SOC (System On Chip)
    - We can connect shields (Shields - addon functionalities)
    - Can connect multiple Pi’s together
    - Microprocessor
    - Can load a linux OS on it
    - Pi uses ARM
    - Connect to sensors or actuators

- **Interfaces**:- 
    - GPIO
    - UART
    - SPI
    - I2C
    - PWM
    
## Serial & Parallel
